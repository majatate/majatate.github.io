Although no matter how hard the organization tries, they can’t and won’t always be able to keep athletes in line with these ideals.\nThe only time athlete arrests make the news are when there are serious crimes, such as murders, rapes, and domestic violence, or when popular, well-known athletes commit any kind of crime. Most news organizations covered instances such as Adrian Peterson’s child abuse case or Davante Adam’s interesting assault charge, but not many heard about Adam Jones’ fourth assault charge of his career or Kenny Still’s disorderly conduct arrest in 2020.\nUSA Today has been keeping a running database of NFL player arrest records since 2000. Counting anything from arrests to citations to warrants and more. The database goes into detail about the case and the outcomes.\nDUI’s are easily the most common crime throughout the last 23 years’ worth of NFL arrest data. DUI’s double in total arrests over the next most common crime, domestic violence, with 246 to 122. Overall, DUI’s make up approximately 31% of the top 10 most common crimes.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=TotalCrimes, aes(x=Category, weight = Total),color = \"light grey\")+\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_bar(data = dui, aes(x=Category, weight=Total), fill = \"blue\")+\n  labs(\n    x = \"Type of Crime\",\n    y = \"Number of Arrests\",\n    title = \"DUI's overshadow all other crimes\",\n    subtitle = \"No other crime even comes close to the number of DUI's for NFL players in the last 23 years\",\n    caption = \"By Maja Tate | Source:USA Today, https://databases.usatoday.com/nfl-arrests/\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"DUI_BarChart.png\")\n\n\nDUI’s have continuously stayed the most prominent crime amongst NFL players until a dip in 2017 but reemerged as the top in 2021. Although overall, arrest trends have begun to decrease since 2014. Overall arrest numbers have dropped in recent years without a clear answer to why.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=TotalYears,aes(x=Year, y=Total, group=Category), color= \"grey\")+\n  geom_line(data=DUI,aes(x=Year, y=Total, group=Category), color=\"blue\")+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Total Number of Crime per year\", \n    title=\"DUI consistently stays miles ahead in commonality\", \n    subtitle=\"All crimes trend downward over the years\", \n    caption=\"By Maja Tate | Source:USA Today, https://databases.usatoday.com/nfl-arrests/\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the time, when a player is arrested for something, they tend not to get caught doing it again, but there are a few outliers who don’t learn from their mistakes. Over twelve years from 2005 to 2017, cornerback Adam Jones was arrested 10 times. Interestingly, none of Jones’ arrests had to do with DUI’s.\nJones played for both the Tennesse Titans and the Cincinnati Bengals. His crimes consisted of four assaults, two drug, one alcohol, disorderly conduct, coercion with a gun, and public intoxication.\n\n\nCode\nNewMutated %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    TotalName = \"Total Arrests\",\n    Name = \"Name\",\n    Position = \"Position\"\n  ) %>% \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Cornerback topples league with 10 total arrests in career\",\n    subtitle = \"Most athletes learned their lessons after one arrest, but not all\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\",weight = \"bold\",align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )%>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Maja Tate  |  **Source:** USA Today, https://databases.usatoday.com/nfl-arrests/\")\n  )%>%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")%>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Adam Jones\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Cornerback topples league with 10 total arrests in career\n    \n    \n      Most athletes learned their lessons after one arrest, but not all\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Name\n      Position\n      Total Arrests\n    \n  \n  \n    Adam Jones\nCB\n10\n    Aldon Smith\nLB\n8\n    Kenny Britt\nWR\n7\n    Chris Henry\nWR\n6\n    Letroy Guion\nDT\n5\n    Malik McDowell\nDT\n5\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Maja Tate  |  Source: USA Today, https://databases.usatoday.com/nfl-arrests/\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nAlthough these run ins with the law may seem very common, most NFL players never get involved with the law for anything.

Bart Starr, Brett Favre or Aaron Rodgers? Each of these quarterbacks had incredible careers in Green Bay and have tons of support from the fans, but not all of them can be considered the greatest Packers quarterback of all time, so let’s figure out who truly is.\nNow that Aaron Rodgers is officially a Jet, his career with the Packers can finally be compared to the other great quarterbacks of Green Bay’s past. All three quarterbacks played for roughly the same amount of time in Green Bay. Rodgers played for 18 seasons – three of which were as back up to Favre. Starr and Favre both played for 16 years respectively. Their careers lasted about the same amount of time, making it fairer to compare them now. Although it can be a little hard to compare Starr’s career to Favre and Rodgers’ because football and the NFL were so different during his playing days, but it is still interesting to compare.\nSo, who has done more for the Packers?\nAlthough Starr is not the first quarterback of the Packers franchise, he is the first notable one, winning Super Bowl 1. Starr is a beloved figure in Green Bay, during his era it was common for a player to start and finish his career for the same team, which can’t be said for the other two quarterbacks in question. He played for 16 seasons with the franchise and won five championships, two of which were during the modern Superbowl era. All of those championships took place within the span of seven years from 1961 to 1967. Along with those championships, Starr had many other career accomplishments with the Packers including two Super Bowl MVP awards, one NFL MVP award, four Pro Bowl Nominations. He has also been inducted into both the Pro Football and Packers Hall of Fame in 1977.\nFavre wasn’t actually drafted by the Packers, but the fan base welcomed him in right away. After years of mediocre football in Wisconsin, it was time for a change. His Packers career started in 1992. He instantly became a fan favorite and led the Packers to back-to-back Super Bowl appearances in the mid to late 1990s, winning one of them. He won three NFL MVP awards and was nominated for the Pro Bowl 11 times in his career for the Packers. Favre was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016. Throughout his 20-year playing career, he played for four teams, the Falcons, Packers, Jets and Vikings, but the majority of his career was spent in Green Bay. He brought up back to the Packers’, but it was his successor who really brought dedication and support back to Wisconsin.\nRodgers has been the starting quarterback for the Packers for the last 15 years and has brought so much joy to Lambeau Field. He consistently ruined the lives of other NFC North teams fanbases, there was even a point where Wikipedia listed him as the owner of the Chicago Bears. The rise of social media started during Rodgers’ tenure possibly resulting in the over amount of respect and support to him by the fans. That respect was well deserved as proven by his four NFL MVP awards, two of those back-to-back in 2020 and 2021, one Super Bowl MVP and one Super Bowl win and his eight Pro Bowl nominations. Even when the Packers were having a bad season, he came out positive telling reporters quotes such as “Run the table” and “R-E-L-A-X.” Without fail, following those statements he would help turn the team around and send them into the playoffs.\nThe main job for quarterbacks is to score touchdowns. The more touchdowns you score the better you are, technically. Even with one less season as a starter, Rodgers absolutely dominates the franchise with the most touchdowns made. He officially tied Favre on Christmas Day 2021. Throughout his career with the Packers, his lowest total touchdowns for a season was 16 in 2017 when he only played in seven games.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=TotalTD, aes(x=(NAME), weight=Touchdowns), fill = \"#203731\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  geom_bar(data = Rodgers, aes(x=NAME, weight = Touchdowns),fill = \"#FFB612\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Name\",\n    y = \"Total Touchdowns\",\n    title = \"Aaron Rodgers dominates in total\\nPackers touchdowns\",\n    subtitle = \"With 3 years of his career as a backup, Rodgers still takes the lead in total\\ntouchdowns for Green Bay\",\n    caption = \"By Maja Tate | Source: Statmuse.com\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"PackersTD.png\")\n\n\nThrowing an interception is one of the worst things a quarterback can do, so it’s important to compare a player’s touchdowns to interceptions. Football was different in the 1950s and 1960s, there weren’t as many scoring drives as there are now, but it is interesting to notice that the numbers of Starr’s career total interceptions and touchdowns were so close. While Favre has a ton of touchdowns but also still has a significant number of interceptions. Rodgers on the other hand, has less interceptions and more touchdowns than the other two quarterbacks.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=dumbbell, \n    aes(y=NAME, x=Interceptions, xend=Touchdowns),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"Grey\",\n    colour_x = \"#FFB612\",\n    colour_xend = \"#203731\"\n  )+\n  labs(\n    title=\"Aaron Rodgers impressively has the most\\ntotal touchdowns and least interceptions\", \n    subtitle = \"If the <span style = 'color:#203731;'><strong>Touchdowns</strong></span> dot is placed on a higher number than the <span style = 'color:#FFB612;'><strong>Interceptions</strong></span> dot, that is great\",\n    y = \"\", x = \"Interceptions/Touchdowns\",\n    caption = \"By: Maja Tate | Source: Statmuse.com\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nPasser rating is determined by calculating the total yards, touchdowns, pass attempts, completions and interceptions by a quarterback during the season. Once Rodgers became a starter, his yearly passer rating consistently stayed way above any year from Starr and Favre’s careers.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_line(data= QB, aes(x=SEASON, y=RATE, color = NAME)) + facet_wrap(~NAME, scales = \"free_x\")+\n  labs(\n    title=\"Aaron Rodgers is always ahead\", \n    subtitle = \"Once Rodgers became a starter, his passer ratings stayed consistently above\\nFavre and Starr\",\n    caption = \"By: Maja Tate | Source: Statmuse.com\",\n    x = \"Season\", y = \"Passer Rating\"\n  )+\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of these quarterbacks have their own reasons to be loved by the fanbase, but Aaron Rodgers statistically is by far the best quarterback for the franchise. He gave the fans consistency year after year, exciting touchdowns and most of the time a playoff berth.\nWill the Packers’ new starting quarterback Jordan Love be able to live up to the outstanding careers that his predecessors had before him? His three years under Rodgers are very similar to Rodgers’ three years under Favre, if not better. In his two years as a backup, he has thrown 3 touchdowns while Rodgers only threw one. Love has seen four more starts as a backup than Rodgers did at the time.\nOnly time will tell if Love will end up being just as good if not better than the Green Bay quarterbacks who came before him."
